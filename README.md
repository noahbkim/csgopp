# csgopp

A generalized, high-performance library for working with CS:GO demos. All credit goes to [`markus-wa`'s `demoinfocs-golang`](https://github.com/markus-wa/demoinfocs-golang), without which all of this would have been impossible.

This project provides a couple things:

- A C++ framework for simulating CS:GO demos and observing high-level events.
- A CLI tool that serves as a proof of concept for the library.
- Python bindings and a Pythonic interface for this framework that facilitates handling events in Python callbacks.
